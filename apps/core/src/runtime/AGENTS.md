# Runtime Notes

- Live provider text deltas may contain only whitespace or leading whitespace.
  Runtime streaming must preserve those deltas until the channel stream buffer
  formats the complete visible text.
- The Claude CLI remote-control path was removed. Do not reintroduce direct
  provider-specific remote-control spawning in runtime; any future equivalent
  must be a provider-neutral application capability with explicit permission
  and adapter ownership.
