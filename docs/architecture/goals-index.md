# Goals Index — execution queue

Master ordered list of engineering goals so they can be executed one after the
other. Each row links a detailed goal-prompt / audit / roadmap doc in this
folder. Status: **in-flight** · **ready** (scoped, blocked only on an earlier
row) · **roadmap** (needs an earlier cycle + some design) · **ideation** (not
yet scoped) · **shipped** (reference).

Every implementation cycle runs through the gantry-goal-pipeline (Codex
implements, Claude orchestrates) with a mandatory Codex plan-validation pass on
the goal doc before stage 1, per AGENTS.md.

**Standing habit (user directive 2026-07-19): bug-pattern-driven simplification.**
At every cycle closeout, classify that cycle's review findings into pattern
families; recurring families re-rank this queue toward the simplification that
retires them. Families observed so far (2026-07-19 session, ~35 findings):
(1) same fact stored twice with different lifecycles — the dominant family;
(2) mutation-before-authorization / delivery-failure confused with commit
failure; (3) consolidation fidelity loss when unifying copies; (4) generated
defaults blind to deployment reality (migrations); (5) type-system lies.
Family 1 evidence spans permission storage (cured by #233), settings export
(Group C), and async tasks (callable-agent follow-up state added NEW jsonb-key
state in privateCorrelationJson) — which is why the durable-work primitive
precedes Group C. 2026-07-19 validation-loop additions: family 3 struck again
(appId-less desired-state provider vs its appId-passing sibling — ponytail
slice 1), family 2 flavor in Slack attachment double-failure reported as
success, and a fresh TOCTOU (workspace attachment containment) reinforcing the
B2 hardening batch.

## Execution order (run top-to-bottom)

**Now — three implementation lanes running in parallel (2026-07-19):**

1. **Ponytail audit Phase 3** — slice 1 COMMITTED (N1/N5-N7/N9, AR1 19→0,
   app-scoped desired-state provider); **slice 2 in flight** (AR2+F5+F14 canonical
   routing + deferred trigger-bridge removal); then slice 3 (F9+N2-N4+N8), Phases
   4-6; Phases 7-9 (DB baselining + live restamp) LAST, only after explicit user
   cutover go + the live-settings runbook in the branch execution ledger.
   _(worktree `wt-ponytail`, `feature/ponytail-audit`)_
2. **S3/MinIO file-artifact bytes** — PROTOCOL DECIDED (user 2026-07-20):
   pending-state row + upload + verified commit + TTL janitor for orphans. Lane
   stays LOW PRIORITY (live uses local; opt-in path) — resume with that protocol
   when prioritized. `artifact-store-s3-goal-prompt.md`
   _(worktree `wt-attach`, `feature/s3-file-artifacts`)_
3. **Durable-work primitive** — DEFERRED until ponytail ships (user
   2026-07-20): it refactors jobs/interactions state that Phases 5-6 delete/move.
   Becomes the FIRST post-cutover lane on the settled tree. Plan-validation
   COMPLETE. `durable-work-primitive-goal-prompt.md`
   _(worktree `wt-convo`, `feature/durable-work-primitive`)_
4. **Media render capability + environment-facts guidance** — V4 SHAPE LOCKED
   (user 2026-07-20): FACADE-PREFLIGHT v1 — provisioner + facade + selected
   skill + env-facts; capability/inventory/admission machinery CUT (3 rounds
   NOT-SAFE → YAGNI). One focused validation round on the v4 delta, then
   implementation queues after the E2E gate lane. `media-render-goal-prompt.md`
   _(worktree `wt-media`, `feature/media-render-capability`)_
5. **Route-loader dedup + conversationId leak (incident closeout)** — the
   durable fix behind the 2026-07-20 routing incident: loader imports every
   active `conversation-route:%` row without dedup by chat+account, and the
   settings projection leaks the settings key into `route.conversationId`.
   Small fix lane + regression tests (incl. the sourceAgentFolderJids
   chat-jid derivation test skipped during the live hotfix).
   _(worktree `wt-routefix`, `fix/route-loader-dedup`)_
6. **Permission floor + command-class promotion** — grill-scoped 2026-07-20.
   Stay-direct posture confirmed. auto_strict becomes the new-agent default
   (deterministic read-only pre-gate + YOLO backstop under the classifier) AND
   "allow for future" persists a user-confirmed command-NAME class scoped to
   conversation+agent (kills the novel-task prompt flood). Tight scope:
   env-facts defers to media Stage 5, audit-write fix is separate.
   `permission-floor-and-promotion-goal-prompt.md`
7. **Fail-loud audit writes (separate tiny lane)** — `runtime_events` insert in
   `publishGatewayUseAudit` has thrown ~98× since 2026-07-04 (WARN-swallowed);
   durable credential/model-usage audit silently not persisting. Fix the insert
   + add a failure counter so silent audit loss can't hide. Not yet scoped.
8. **Agent E2E CI merge gate** — grill-scoped 2026-07-20, full build one goal.
   Packaged real-image runtime + real agent turn + evidence artifacts; wire the
   omitted `test:integration:postgres` into CI; GRANULAR permission + capability
   matrices at the integration layer (dedup existing tests) + thin real-turn E2E
   proofs; skill (internal-comms) + MCP (everything server) fixtures; path-map
   policy classifier with `e2e-reviewed` override; hermetic always-required +
   label-gated live model matrix; `agent-e2e-gate` required check. i-have-adhd
   hard-excluded. `agent-e2e-ci-merge-gate-goal-prompt.md` — plan-validation next.

Per-lane loop: codex lands → independent verify (typecheck + FULL unit +
throwaway-DB integration when schema touched) → local autoreview to clean →
commit. Merge only on explicit user "merge NNN".

**Next — PRIORITIZED by user 2026-07-19 ("UX improvements and latency of agent
messages as next, that's important"):**

4. **Messaging hot-path** — Stages 1-2 SHIPPED (#235 cleanup, #236 latency:
   first-token piping, cache parity, SDK off critical path). **Stage 3 CLOSED
   (user 2026-07-20, YAGNI)**: hydration watermark / upsert-collapse /
   double-fetch / liveness-heartbeat contracts stay unbuilt — reopen ONLY on a
   real latency/liveness complaint. `messaging-hotpath-and-liveness-goal-prompt.md`
5. **Model management: unify then UX** — FINALIZED 2026-07-19; starts when the
   ponytail lane closes (shares the settings parser/renderer surface). 8 decisions
   locked (aggressive knob collapse, sticky conversation switch via
   settings-approval gate, tokens+cache stats, disclosed cheapest-sibling
   auto-upgrade + capabilities facet for image→text-only); folds in
   `status-cost-cache-visibility-goal-prompt.md`; Stage B rides the V3 phrase
   seam. `model-management-goal-prompt.md`

**Then — medium, scoped:**

6. **Jobs recovery-intent → columns + CAS.** `coordination-representation-audit-2026-07-18.md` (B1) — may fold into goal 4.
7. **Coordination hardening batch** — skill-install advisory lock, session-compaction Set, TOCTOU fallback, canonical-serializer unify, stringify dedup keys. `coordination-representation-audit-2026-07-18.md` (B2 + low) — may fold into goal 4.
8. **`desired-state-current-export` rewrite** — schema-driven merge, fail-loud on unknown fields. `coordination-representation-audit-2026-07-18.md` (Group C)
9. **Permission decision simplification** — one sequencer, one mode vocabulary, one authority block, one copy layer. `permission-simplification-goal-prompt.md`
10. **Remaining Fable arch cycles** (#2–#8). `fable-architecture-review-2026-07-16.md`

**Roadmap — after the above, needs design:**

13. **KB / document ingestion per workspace.** `platform-roadmap-2026-07.md` (#1)
14. **Tenant isolation hardening** — hostile-tenant review; verified via the E2E harness matrix. `platform-roadmap-2026-07.md` (#3)
15. **E2E persona/topology harness** — goal-prompt drafted in session scratchpad _(promote into this folder as `e2e-harness-goal-prompt.md`)_.
16. **Connector strategy execution** — direct OAuth, `providers.yaml` templates, org-owned GitHub+Google v1 _(design doc in `~/.gstack` projects dir)_.

**Ideation — not yet scoped (do not auto-start):**

- **Prompt-driven flows** — natural-language flows, not node/edge authoring; deferred.
- **Identity + memory MCP** — personId alias (link-don't-merge), person-scoped memory MCP, UI last; rides the connector strategy.
- **Blueprints + per-tenant evals.** `platform-roadmap-2026-07.md` (#4, LATER)
